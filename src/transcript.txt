00:05
hey welcome back we're going to start up
00:07
with a we're gonna do a module on youth
00:10
violence and gangs we're gonna talk a
00:12
little bit about the transnational
00:13
aspects of gangs some of what's happened
00:16
in LA historically and Ronda BLET is
00:20
going to help walk us through it he's
00:22
one of the revered experts on gangs I
00:26
was originally introduced to him he was
00:29
referred to as the godfather of gang
00:31
intervention and he's definitely lived
00:35
up to that title but Ron you're always
00:38
interested in some really interesting
00:39
things tell me a little bit about what's
00:41
happening in LA with with with gangs
00:45
with groups with cliques
00:47
how are things settling out where
00:49
where's the power and what do we really
00:51
need to be thinking about from a
00:53
perspective of criminal justice when
00:56
when we study that at kuren here in LA
01:00
good question
01:02
I think la is in a holding pattern right
01:04
now in a number of ways the city seems
01:09
to be this from my point of view the
01:12
city seems to be frozen into a state of
01:15
inactivity at the mayor√≠a level at the
01:18
council manic level at the grid level
01:23
there's a lot of talk about stuff that
01:25
going on behind the scenes but not
01:27
really a change that I see directly that
01:30
deals with intervention in the dealing
01:32
with gang members is and I've seen this
01:35
in other areas once the intervention
01:39
helped police to lower the level of
01:42
violence to a certain point the people
01:45
in control started seeing or
01:48
acknowledging that the people who are
01:51
capable of lowering the level of
01:53
violence are not nice people to deal
01:56
with in City Hall and they don't dress
01:58
nice and they don't talk nice and so I
02:00
see them more and more encouraging the
02:03
hiring of more acceptable types of
02:06
people Corp truly less capable of
02:09
dealing with violence and I don't see
02:11
another open-mindedness of hiring
02:15
hardcore guys until there's a
02:18
a true spike in violence but overall the
02:22
level of violence in LA is down to
02:26
historical low levels in the 50s with
02:28
some minor spikes in the in the Vermont
02:31
corridor and and a lot of on uncounted
02:36
violence going on in East LA what's
02:39
happening in East LA oh and can you also
02:41
just explain what grid is gang reduction
02:45
youth that de ce g ry d gang reduction
02:49
youth development it's ended up it's in
02:54
the mayor's office it's an independent
02:56
not an independent but it's a separate
02:59
group that was put together in o8 but
03:05
with some pressure from a woman by the
03:10
name of Connie Connie rice working with
03:13
the then mayor via Carozza
03:15
and this the grid is a unit and which
03:22
monies from the city goes through here
03:24
to particular areas that have been
03:27
measured as having high violence rather
03:30
than an equal amount going to every
03:32
single one of the 15 council Matic
03:38
districts that's more it helps to have
03:40
it more specific that's basically grid
03:43
they also do some measurements they also
03:45
do some training all right and tell me
03:49
about what's what's happening in the
03:51
city with the things that we care about
03:52
with violence intimidation some other
03:55
things I thought you're saying we're at
03:57
historic lows but there are some areas
04:00
that are still of concern in the city
04:03
that will happen as long as we have the
04:06
enact in equitability zuv poverty and
04:12
poor schools of police that have not
04:17
quite got the idea of that you don't
04:19
utilize people you don't and people are
04:21
not animals or but those are long term
04:26
tasks to work on what's happening within
04:29
the the violence world
04:31
is a breakdown of the historical gang
04:34
that are based on Geographic lines now
04:38
that was more so Mexican or Mexican
04:42
American or Chicano than it was with
04:44
black because blacks historically have
04:47
had to move out of their neighborhoods
04:48
more often than not because they weren't
04:50
really allowed to have area that their
04:52
own geographic areas so in that
04:57
breakdown of fighting for turf there has
05:02
been and for a number of reasons one is
05:05
the use of the iPhone and another is the
05:10
is the increased ability to move in over
05:14
long long distances instantly the
05:19
historic large gangs that fought each
05:21
other are now being broken down into
05:25
cliques and and mores specified types of
05:31
groups for instance you'll see groups
05:33
that are based on that are get together
05:35
just to burglarize other groups just to
05:39
do armed robberies other groups deal
05:42
with sheer drugs between between gangs
05:45
are between cliques internalized in the
05:47
gangs and in some places you see guys
05:51
reaching across their own gang to
05:53
another gang member and they'll get
05:56
together to do a particular crime and
05:58
then they'll go and then they'll split
06:01
after it's over and go back to their own
06:03
turfs you see that a lot across the
06:05
nation now more and more as the the
06:08
leadership are taken out there's a break
06:11
down to the next level and the more the
06:14
leadership is taken out the more chaos
06:16
reigns this same type of wrongheaded
06:22
thinking has been taking place in the
06:24
Middle East for years you can see how
06:26
effective that is cutting the head
06:29
cutting the head off only increases the
06:32
level of violence oh you also see it
06:35
with the cartels in Mexico cutting the
06:37
head off increases the level of violence
06:39
increases the number of individuals
06:42
fighting for power and fighting for
06:44
control
06:45
the drug trade or the gun trade or that
06:46
slave trade whatever we call it and I
06:49
prefer slave trade to this human
06:51
trafficking stuff because it's basically
06:54
slavery right ya know that's really
06:56
interesting you brought up some of these
06:58
different areas that are experiencing
07:00
similar trends and something you and I
07:03
have talked a little bit about or have
07:06
started to sort of try to make some
07:07
connections with is this idea of the
07:10
correlation between repression or brutal
07:13
repression and radicalization of youth
07:15
we talked about in Egypt with the sort
07:19
of recruiting of Isis that's happening
07:21
right in the in the prisons there and
07:24
and you and you agreed you thought that
07:27
there was some connection with what's
07:28
happening in the in the northern
07:29
triangle and maybe even in the streets
07:31
here in in the United States what what
07:34
what are some of the similarities in in
07:36
that police or government repression of
07:40
individuals and and sort of pushing
07:42
people into doing things they wouldn't
07:44
do otherwise how does that work I like
07:48
the question an interesting thing is our
07:51
government you are not really
07:54
radicalized if you're not a Muslim so
07:57
exactly the same conditions that turn a
08:01
person who happens to be a Muslim into a
08:05
radical into a person full of rage and
08:08
hatred to make him one lash out it's the
08:11
exact same thing that turns a non Muslim
08:14
into a gang member that makes him full
08:16
of a rage and hate and we make him one
08:18
in to lash out
08:19
but because the monies are only into in
08:22
a certain area
08:23
the government says only this is
08:25
radicalization therefore the same put
08:28
two guys in a prison cell one is a
08:31
Muslim one is a Christian they go
08:33
through the same things they go through
08:34
the same repressions they grew up the
08:36
same way they both become radicalized in
08:39
the sense of full of hatred and full of
08:41
blame and willing to go out and do
08:43
something about it the guy who is a
08:45
Muslim considered a radicalized Muslim
08:47
and they'll be monies going down to deal
08:49
with that the other is just a gang
08:50
member get rid of him or ignore him
08:52
until it he does something mm-hm
08:55
you see this taking place to a
08:58
huge extent in in the Triangle in in in
09:01
in the northern triangle which is
09:02
Guatemala Salvador and Honduras is that
09:07
the police and the military in those
09:11
three countries in conjunction with
09:14
these death squads that make made up of
09:17
either police and/or army and/or rich
09:19
people who are tend to be a lighter skin
09:22
they count on repression to keep the
09:26
gang members down and what happens is
09:28
the number of gang members go up the
09:31
number of the the violence goes up the
09:33
the youth becomes so radicalized that
09:37
they become Savage and what we see
09:39
taking place is freaking out the people
09:40
on the East Coast and up in Long Island
09:43
is just simply a logical extension of
09:47
what happens when you treat people like
09:48
in a savage way they become savages it
09:52
it happens everywhere like it in LA
09:55
there was a long hatred between police
09:58
and gang members mutual hate well we've
10:03
been working on it for more than a
10:04
decade now in a number of ways so that
10:06
there's still not there's still no love
10:09
fest but both sides have learned that at
10:14
least we can work in harmony in separate
10:19
and parallel lines to focus on the
10:21
violence problem and and the tension has
10:24
gone down and in areas were it's been
10:28
grit outlined where you have
10:29
intervention workers focusing there's
10:32
less violence toward police as opposed
10:37
to an area outside whether there's no
10:39
intervention workers the same thing
10:42
should happen in every city or every
10:45
area where people learn to work in
10:49
harmony rather than against each other
10:52
harmony is usually decided by police and
10:58
it means more often than not do what we
11:03
say give us information that we want and
11:06
we'll work in harmony that's not the way
11:08
it works I think that police should be
11:10
worked with all the time
11:12
I do not think that a civilian well take
11:16
it back
11:17
a civilian should give the police as
11:21
much information as they can on any
11:23
anything that takes place I think that's
11:25
that's righteous that's the way the
11:27
government is its supposed to act but a
11:30
person who's been an ex-gang member or
11:32
who is who is an intervention or an
11:36
intervention worker if they act like a
11:40
regular citizen to give the police
11:42
information is to set them up for being
11:44
killed which is why we say do not give
11:47
the police information let them do the
11:49
job themselves but you can work with
11:50
guys so that they don't reach so that
11:53
the guys do not retaliate and the whole
11:55
emphasis of intervention is non
11:58
retaliation try to tuck guys into not
12:01
seeking revenge with police it's do your
12:04
job specifically do it fare and target
12:08
who you're after don't throw a blank a
12:12
blank attack on anyone a problem that
12:16
we're having in El Salvador is the
12:18
police are reaching the same sort of
12:20
hatred and toward the gang member as the
12:22
gang member has toward the police so
12:24
it's war so tell me about here in the
12:29
States there are a few different
12:30
approaches I think towards violence
12:34
reduction with with gang involved youth
12:36
so you have David Kennedy approach
12:39
national network for Safe Communities
12:40
you've got Gary sucking in Chicago with
12:42
cures cure violence model you have la
12:45
the LA model over here and sometimes
12:51
called grid by some but tell me about
12:54
the difference in approaches and how you
12:57
guys and am I using the right
12:59
terminology who's it's closed who's
13:01
who's doing what and what what seems to
13:04
be working best in our cuz I know that
13:07
you're working with people from across
13:08
the country and you get to you get
13:10
exposure to a lot of these different
13:11
approaches what's working best and what
13:13
are they called I think the simplest way
13:16
is that the Kennedy model which which
13:18
was created in in Boston and used
13:21
New York with Kennedy coming out of the
13:26
law school in in New York the Kennedy
13:32
model has an emphasis on police it's
13:36
basically a carrot and stick approach
13:38
where so-called leaders are brought
13:41
together sat down and told this is what
13:45
will happen to you if you continue your
13:47
crime and if you don't continue a crime
13:50
you'll get all these goodies that's a
13:52
very simplistic way of putting it that
13:54
there's that model the slut can model
13:57
which couple comes out of Chicago is
14:00
broader and that it basically says that
14:05
the the workers will have nothing to do
14:09
with the police do not trust the police
14:12
will not deal with the police at all and
14:14
that they are quasi independent groups
14:19
the slut gun model does not give very
14:24
much support to the intervention workers
14:26
basically if you got your in trouble on
14:28
something you're on your own
14:30
the a positive thing about that approach
14:33
is the fact that it uses a public health
14:44
assessment on how people are and how a
14:47
community has looked at the weaknesses
14:48
of it was a public know that you mean
14:50
like his epidemiological background
14:53
looking at diseases and how they spread
14:55
right right diseases the is the would be
14:59
the violent the violence area the
15:01
weakness is that gang a gang area is a
15:06
violent area is not as not a disease
15:08
area right it doesn't do people don't
15:10
know how to deal with violence both are
15:13
models the the kennedy model is good in
15:17
the sense of if you have an area where
15:21
you have plenty of stick and plenty of
15:25
carrot and you can get the real shot
15:28
colors you have a chance to put put put
15:31
the level of violence down the LA
15:35
consciously does not use the model
15:38
concept we take what we think is is
15:40
strong with with the Kennedy strong with
15:43
the with the slut gun and then what we
15:46
learned in the LA approach is that
15:48
intervention prevention re-entry
15:52
targeted policing all have to work
15:55
together in conjunction with
15:57
governmental entities and to approach an
16:01
area that is unique in and of itself and
16:03
do what is effective that's why we
16:07
resist talking about a model the
16:09
weakness of that of the Kennedy model is
16:13
that there's not that many areas that
16:17
can give a strong carrot so they
16:19
emphasize the stick number one number
16:23
two the real shot caller is the real
16:26
tough guys are not going to come in sit
16:28
down and take a bunch of guff from
16:29
police and be told of it and like this
16:32
and then we're gonna do this to you so
16:35
probation officers who receive a lot of
16:37
the pressure to go out and grab some
16:38
guys to get guys who are already on
16:40
probation already on parole who they
16:42
have control over already okay come and
16:44
sit and listen to the police tell you
16:46
how tough they're gonna treat you so it
16:48
becomes a joke in almost every city that
16:50
we've been in when we talk about that
16:54
approach there's there's there's
16:55
laughing that takes place or this is
16:58
more setup to get guys shot than it is
16:59
to help anybody else so that in that
17:02
with the slut can approach we learned in
17:05
LA and we preach this that you cannot
17:09
ignore the police or be hostile to the
17:12
police I mean they're there as much as
17:15
anybody else they know the gang members
17:17
as well as you do they there has to be
17:20
some sort of mutual respect developed
17:24
between the intervention community and
17:26
the police community so that they work
17:28
at least in tandem to focus on the level
17:31
of violence that is the LA approach this
17:35
their strengths and weaknesses with the
17:38
other two but we don't we don't touch
17:41
either of them interesting yeah that's
17:44
that's that's it's really interesting on
17:46
how the approach works
17:48
what are the what are the tools that you
17:51
use when you well what's what's the
17:55
triggering event for you guys to get a
17:57
call what is their issues their shooting
17:59
they say hey we got a brother over here
18:01
and here's the sister here's the parents
18:03
do you what what sort of information to
18:06
the people that you interact with or
18:08
that you work with how do they how do
18:10
they get involved and what's the
18:11
introduction like this guy is credible
18:13
he's you know he's been he's been in the
18:16
life before like how do i how does that
18:18
introduction happen how do you how do
18:20
the people come together it's it's
18:25
simply putting this put this in three
18:26
phases in the first phase you work with
18:30
families you work with the community and
18:33
you earn their respect by doing favors
18:37
by helping them in any way you can and a
18:40
lot of emphasis is put on the females
18:43
the wives the daughters etc etc the
18:48
middle level is the crisis mode the
18:51
crisis is when somebody has been shot an
18:54
act of violence has taken place calls go
18:58
up the police get the report
19:01
automatically information goes out to
19:04
all intervention workers and then those
19:06
who work in that area are called to it
19:09
but more often than not the intervention
19:12
workers will get calls from come the
19:14
community way before the police get any
19:18
kind of calls and couldn't send out that
19:20
that information the third aspect after
19:24
the crisis is maintenance you've dealt
19:27
with a crisis if you lower the level you
19:28
lord the crisis heat level but people
19:32
especially for the people who have been
19:34
from the site we've been attacked they
19:36
have to be worked with consistently so
19:39
as not to want revenge in in six
19:42
different areas of the six different
19:44
triggers of violence revenge is the most
19:46
difficult to deal with it's the hardest
19:49
to put out and more often than not it
19:51
has to burn out and so we emphasize to
19:55
get with the side that's been attacked
19:58
so as so that the revenge step does not
20:01
begin and
20:02
that you keep guys talking the people
20:04
who are most effective that that rx gang
20:07
members and people have been trained to
20:09
deal effectively once they've got out of
20:11
the life
20:12
we have heavy screening for these guys
20:15
because a lot in the beginning a lot of
20:16
them were on both sides and we have to
20:18
get rid of them and they have to be
20:20
screened out a good way to get rid of
20:22
them is simply ask the community what's
20:25
this guy in the community always knows
20:26
before anybody else does and you can ask
20:28
them those kind of questions in building
20:31
that in areas like in Central America
20:36
where gang members are not allowed to
20:39
even to be an intervention and to work
20:42
with a gang member is it could get you
20:44
arrested
20:44
it's literally counterproductive in
20:46
dealing with the problem of violence but
20:48
the three areas of before that crisis
20:51
crisis after the crisis whatever the
20:54
terminology they want to use for it
20:56
requires people who are have spent a
21:01
good deal of time in the community
21:04
working with people and earning their
21:06
trust everything is based upon personal
21:09
relationships and trust everything is
21:11
based on personal relationships and
21:13
Trust okay and you're working in sent
21:18
you guys are working in Central America
21:19
as well how do you develop that same
21:23
level of trust or the network of people
21:25
that you can that you can work with to
21:27
get them to deal with similar situations
21:31
in the last couple of years
21:35
our our team has been brought in by AI
21:41
dee' and creative to focus on two
21:46
colonias in two cities in El Salvador we
21:51
are not allowed to use X gang members
21:53
because of the laws of that country and
21:55
so the people who have been recruited or
21:58
given to us to deal with we've been
22:01
allowed to do some screening out our
22:03
people who have grown up in these
22:05
communities but are non gang member in
22:10
one community in one
22:13
who are they and they're just people who
22:14
are interested in being in this line of
22:16
work and they're interested and have
22:18
they been trained or they just happen to
22:21
have the network of in one community
22:24
they yeah well I won't give you names
22:28
but in in one of the communities these
22:31
guys have been working in a targeted
22:35
community for a while basically like our
22:39
people who work in ambulances okay guys
22:47
who would go to pick up the body schools
22:50
would take care of people who've been
22:51
shot spawn first responders all that
22:53
type of stuff
22:54
so they are they have developed a sense
22:56
of trust in the community so it's just a
22:59
step to then do deal with the gang
23:01
members they are they're more advanced
23:03
when we train them they understand what
23:05
we're talking about the people in the
23:07
other community there were anybody like
23:10
that there and so a an organization that
23:14
we would call a prevention oriented
23:17
which had a fairly strong infrastructure
23:20
was picked not by us but given to us and
23:24
said we'll go pick the guys type of guys
23:27
you want so we screened them as best we
23:30
could and then they hired their they
23:32
chose who they were gonna hire and so
23:34
been working on them they are behind
23:36
right in the sense because they wanted
23:39
to go out and start doing what an
23:40
intervention worker does and we said
23:42
wait develop relationships do little
23:46
favors for people so we have to hold the
23:48
ones back to keep them from getting hurt
23:50
while the other is weak we are able to
23:53
support more and more the idea of
23:58
helping people for the second helping
24:00
people is usually understood best by
24:03
people in the religious community we're
24:04
starting to train people in the
24:05
religious community to do that right now
24:07
but also trying to get them to say
24:09
helping people and proselytizing are two
24:12
separate things and guys might resent
24:14
you proselytizing when you should be
24:16
just helping so that that has to be
24:18
worked out is there a strong group
24:24
inside of the
24:25
the the faith-based community in Central
24:28
America that that want to actually be
24:30
active and involved in this kind of work
24:31
yes there is yes there is and we've been
24:34
bringing groups of people from El
24:38
Salvador over here as it is there are
24:41
6000 nuns in El Salvador and nuns are
24:46
hardcore when anything so we've been
24:48
doing everything we can to get the nuns
24:49
involved in this and many of the pastors
24:51
are there's a very high percentage of of
24:54
charismatic and evangelical in El
25:00
Salvador right now so hopefully a
25:02
combination of the Catholic Catholic
25:05
Church with the evangelicals and the
25:09
charismatic can really be helpful the
25:12
differences is that the at the part of
25:19
the Catholic Church that would be the
25:22
most effective for us got taken out when
25:24
Romero was assassinated and and so I
25:28
have the new the new hierarchy is a
25:32
little more conservative with
25:36
evangelicals in the charismatic they are
25:38
they're hot to go there I'll give you an
25:41
example few weeks ago we had a group of
25:45
pastors over here on a training and one
25:49
of the pastor was very quiet and a
25:52
second day at lunch he and I were
25:54
sitting across me and he told me that
25:57
the previous week his son who would just
26:02
finished med school and was ready to
26:04
start his internship had been playing
26:09
football we call the soccer right with
26:13
with with four friends they went to one
26:15
of the local store before they were
26:17
going to go home to buy some pops soft
26:22
drinks mmm they were outside the store a
26:24
car came by stop guy got out our two
26:28
guys got out with automatic weapons and
26:30
just sprayed them all killed his son
26:33
killed another guy wounded two and one
26:36
ran
26:38
he got the call and he and his wife
26:41
rushed over there and his son had been
26:44
hit in the head everything's they took
26:46
him took him to the hospital
26:48
the doctor said no way so he was dead
26:53
the next day
26:54
turns out the gang had got the word that
26:58
one of them had was snitching and so
27:03
they the gang decided to shoot them all
27:06
to make sure that they got the guy who
27:08
was a snitch so they killed a snitch and
27:11
they killed his son who had done nothing
27:15
and just wanted to help people he had
27:18
then said he had told his wife I I can't
27:25
go to LA for this I know I just can't do
27:28
it
27:28
his wife said maybe you learned
27:30
something there that will make sure you
27:32
can bring back and this won't happen
27:33
again that was 11 days before we smoked
27:36
nine days before we spoke he buried his
27:39
son and he came to our our training and
27:45
he said he was glad yet can well but
27:47
that's the dedication of these people
27:49
mm-hm
27:50
amazing thanks for sharing that so this
27:56
is a public policy group these are
27:58
students who are learning public policy
28:01
what can the world of public policy
28:04
offer to the work that you're doing
28:06
whether it's research helping to make
28:09
sure that laws or institutions are
28:10
adjusted in a certain way bringing some
28:13
sort of understanding out into the
28:14
community to make this work
28:16
easier to do what what can the public
28:18
policy community do to help you guys
28:21
everything everything we have two
28:25
attorneys at an urban piece that's their
28:30
whole job we have a half a dozen other
28:33
people that's their whole job you focus
28:36
on policy you change the policies you
28:38
change what takes place you can help
28:41
deal and alleviate these problems of
28:42
violence one of the things they're
28:44
working on right now is these rules
28:49
where anybody can be
28:50
put on the gang injunction and they yeah
28:53
well gang injunction that's one thing
28:55
that we'll be working on because
28:56
everybody could be put on gang Junction
28:58
you and I grew up together and we're
29:00
brothers you're on the gang if I'm
29:02
messing with you they can get me I'm
29:05
just talking to you they can get me or
29:06
put you away
29:07
that's the injunction another thing is
29:10
from field reports guys are said this
29:14
guy is in a gang that I let the field
29:15
goes in goes into the state gang hard to
29:19
get yourself off of that one yeah it's
29:21
almost impossible yeah we have we have
29:22
attorneys working on both all of it has
29:24
to do with policy all of it has to do
29:27
with policy the policy of selling crack
29:31
gives you a 5-time harder judgment than
29:37
just selling cocaine was well intended
29:40
but look at the monster it created that
29:43
policy has to change your students
29:47
forget them through first yeah and then
29:49
there's all kinds of policies they can
29:51
work on it I've only become a late
29:54
believer in the need to change policy
29:59
yeah it's it's that's a great comment
30:01
and it's a great framework framework to
30:03
work through where where do you see
30:09
where do you see things going for the
30:11
world of violence reduction gang
30:14
intervention next five years in the u.s.
30:19
let's start there that depends a lot on
30:25
how effective the current administration
30:32
is that continuing to divide people
30:35
terrify people and make it easier to
30:39
hate people who are afraid can be
30:46
controlled into learning to hate you
30:49
can't hate someone you're not afraid of
30:53
so a lot depends on that and how our how
30:56
our nation responds to this period of
31:02
time that would be miss vetted Nass then
31:05
what about our what about our white
31:07
power gangs here in across the country
31:11
and they listen to 9ym they're
31:14
responsible for since 91 1 more than 70
31:17
percent of the mass killings and
31:19
killings that have taken place in groups
31:20
killing in the United States have been
31:22
done by white power guys but you never
31:25
hear that
31:25
you know you know everybody talking
31:27
about it I see them getting increasingly
31:29
stronger the they're driven well there's
31:33
two kinds of white power that I've seen
31:36
there's one that's basically anti black
31:38
anti brown anti anti anti based upon
31:42
fear there's another that's more based
31:45
upon real white pride and they're trying
31:48
to say white power just like black power
31:50
was an attempt to say we are somebody so
31:52
I those are different and I don't think
31:55
they should be approached in the same
31:58
way that the the more virulent type of
32:01
white power because there's white pride
32:03
and there's white power the white power
32:05
people talk about white pride but
32:07
they're more anti the the white pride
32:12
people are trying to get themselves
32:15
together in what are what are we cuz
32:17
they've never had to face the idea of
32:18
white as a group or white as a tribe
32:21
it's just us and then people are talking
32:24
and all of a sudden there's a I'm white
32:26
oh yeah well what does it mean to be
32:28
white first time I brought it up in a
32:31
you know I was doing some training at a
32:33
local college this was in the early late
32:37
seventies early eighties and if when I
32:40
was talking about Asians as one thing to
32:42
this group of teachers talking about
32:44
blacks I'm talking about Browns
32:47
everything was cool when I started
32:48
talking about whites the teachers
32:50
weren't crazy mmm why do you have to
32:52
talk about that what do you have to
32:53
bring up all that cultural stuff for we
32:56
don't have a culture what the white
32:58
culture is so dominant how can you see
33:00
yourself in a mirror look how hostile
33:03
you are and oh my god that's what I got
33:05
to deal with and that's what the country
33:07
dealing with right now you have people
33:09
who are for the first time having to
33:11
question their whiteness mm-hmm I mean
33:13
it was only about five years ago
33:14
somebody said Ron you are a you have
33:18
white was it not white a sense of and
33:21
tough yeah white entitlement you know
33:23
what's that mean what is white
33:25
entitlement and I had no idea and then
33:30
the guy said Elena have you always been
33:31
this always been that and I said why I
33:33
thought they always put me ahead cuz I
33:35
was smart and I realized yeah cuz I got
33:38
a white puss I got a lot of stuff and I
33:41
got that white you know I know it's not
33:43
white entitlement so much is white
33:44
privilege white privilege white
33:46
privilege okay
33:47
mmm-hmm but no absolutely no now that I
33:51
know what it is I'll use it more
33:53
effectively well I I think I think
33:55
you're hitting I think you're hitting on
33:56
a really good point which is it's hard
33:59
to see obstacles that are not there so
34:01
white privilege comes from doors opening
34:04
that you didn't see open for you yeah I
34:06
accept that ship but there are other
34:08
people who didn't have that door opened
34:10
and so they see that you were able to
34:11
walk through it exactly I think it
34:13
requires communication and a perspective
34:15
to happen but to your point of of the
34:19
radicalized Muslim is a terrorist
34:22
the radicalized white guy is not called
34:25
an angry white guy just an angry white
34:26
guy right and and same thing with gangs
34:28
right so a young black man who is
34:30
involved in a clique group and angry and
34:33
doing some different things well that's
34:34
a gang member but it's people don't say
34:35
the same thing about the white
34:37
equivalent to that person exactly so a
34:40
guy doesn't join a gang because he wants
34:42
to do violent things or criminal things
34:44
he joins a gang because it offers
34:46
something that he's not getting right
34:49
right
34:50
safety protection community love love
34:55
Wow
34:56
so we're in California or right we're a
35:00
bordering state to Mexico what do you
35:03
think we need to do are there in Los
35:05
Angeles or maybe it's with our state
35:07
kind of with the immigration situation
35:10
do is is a current immigration policy
35:15
the deportations the criminalization of
35:19
of illegal entry how is that affecting
35:24
radicalization of youth or of
35:26
indoctrination into gangs or is is the
35:30
difficulty of passage the expensive
35:32
passage does that simply cause people to
35:37
pay more and to get with tougher dudes
35:39
to get through and across and more you
35:42
know big bigger stronger more entrenched
35:44
protected networks to get through how do
35:48
the dynamics change when we start to
35:50
sort of create a tougher more punitive
35:52
border if you have any ideas on it got a
35:56
couple starting from the beginning there
36:00
is no policy there is no policy worth
36:02
the hook one way or another that's
36:04
number one number two people are coming
36:07
up from Central America right now
36:08
because they're scared this is the only
36:12
choices you have when you're in those
36:14
when you're in the triangle of Guatemala
36:15
Honduras El Salvador join a game get
36:20
murdered run or become an addict there
36:26
is no other choice people don't want to
36:29
die there are no jobs the way life is is
36:35
rough and it's abusive the governments
36:40
do not protect them they have to protect
36:43
themselves you either run or you die the
36:49
trail from Central America through
36:52
Mexico to the US border is a trail of
36:56
violence imposed upon them women in when
37:02
they reached the Guatemalan border
37:03
getting ready to go into Mexico
37:05
are already buying stuff knowing or
37:10
provided himself with things knowing
37:13
that they're going to be raped and on
37:16
the trail but they still want to get to
37:18
the United States they want to get to
37:20
the United States because that's the
37:21
only chance they have to live the
37:25
Mexicans going across are now there is a
37:28
net outflow from the United States into
37:31
Mexico
37:32
the
37:32
Mexicans aren't the ones wanting to come
37:34
across here it's essential Americans to
37:36
save their own lives the gang members
37:39
basically prey upon the people who are
37:43
coming up they don't necessarily protect
37:46
them or help them across they prey upon
37:48
them the Coyotes are separate separate
37:53
types of games these in the Maine are
37:55
guys who come from generations of
37:58
smugglers they already have their routes
38:01
the the Sinaloa cartel all the cartels
38:04
that come on the scene alone everything
38:06
there you have been smugglers for 200
38:08
years
38:08
for them it's product product whether
38:11
it's people marijuana cattle goats you
38:15
name it
38:16
cocaine heroin the many of the routes
38:20
now that have been historically run by
38:23
coyotes to bring people in within the
38:26
United States have now been taken over
38:28
by cartels but they don't necessarily go
38:31
together in the main it's when people
38:34
who are coming up.i taking over you mean
38:35
you have to pay tax you have to pay for
38:37
protection to get through or they're
38:38
actually running they're running it now
38:40
they're running it they're running it
38:42
the people who pay coyotes to come
38:45
across that's one thing but people in
38:48
the Maine are just everything is taken
38:49
from them or stolen from them on the way
38:52
up and that's just that preyed upon by
38:53
gangs is more like wolves preying upon
38:55
moving herds the there has been some
39:03
excellent writing done on taking that
39:06
train up here abuse yeah and it it's
39:11
powerful it's powerful one of the things
39:14
you had shared with me a ways back was
39:18
with regards to this idea of human
39:21
trafficking of slavery is it in plain
39:26
sight here in in LA are we yes okay and
39:30
how do we how do we address
39:36
I wouldn't I wouldn't use an innocuous
39:41
term the bureaucrats low like human
39:43
trafficking I'd say flat-out slavery mmm
39:45
number one - because most people what
39:47
they don't they don't want to see things
39:49
and so they give it a little wimpy names
39:51
or have the bureaucrats giving would-be
39:53
names but you have you have slavery
39:56
human slavery in the in the in any field
40:03
that requires intense labor taking place
40:07
right now Chinese the Cambodians are
40:12
heavy heavy groups of slaves working in
40:15
that what looks like an innocuous
40:17
apartment house there might be a hundred
40:20
150 people in there who are basically
40:22
slaves the sex slavery is in in
40:27
different different arenas most of the
40:30
people now who are being trafficked out
40:33
of in the greater LA and out and across
40:35
the country are african-americans being
40:38
trafficked by gangs by their own gang
40:40
members but there are also people who
40:45
are brought up through Tijuana that have
40:49
seen where the women are broken in
40:51
Tijuana but from someplace else
40:52
broken in Tijuana then brought across
40:55
here as sex slave what does that mean to
40:58
be broken into well though they're
41:01
broken so they're compliant they're
41:03
physically emotionally broken and they
41:07
have guys who do just whose job it is to
41:10
break them so that they'll be more
41:11
compliant easier to control and the more
41:15
and more gangs are going and groups are
41:17
going into the human slavery in the
41:19
sexual trafficking basically because you
41:21
can use the the you can use the woman
41:26
over and over and over again and just
41:28
her value goes down because you can
41:31
still been used when they can't be used
41:32
anymore you just get rid of them and
41:34
that's how they deal with it so that's
41:37
the difference between a commodity and
41:38
something that continues to gender yeah
41:40
single-use commodities and with and with
41:42
the women multiple use of commodities
41:45
and and I separate the the sexual aspect
41:48
of it from the
41:49
workers aspect of it mm-hmm what are
41:52
some of the areas that you know if these
41:55
students are looking for opportunities
41:58
for work for areas where they can make
42:02
an impact where they can make a
42:03
difference where where should a UCLA or
42:06
a graduate from another school go I'd
42:11
say be honest with yourself are you
42:14
looking for money are you looking for a
42:16
recognition or are you looking to help
42:18
people if you're looking for money
42:23
and/or recognition go work with the
42:28
government of one sort or another go
42:30
become a professional Social Work type
42:32
of person if you're looking for
42:36
recognition go join go go get involved
42:39
with a foundation if you want to help
42:42
people learn to not be afraid of
42:48
violence per se but it requires an
42:52
internal look and an internal acceptance
42:57
that few people are willing to face on
42:59
their own and often our only face under
43:05
challenging conditions
43:08
my recommendation is look inside be
43:12
honest with yourself
43:15
awesome thanks Ron thank you good I want
43:20
more coffee
