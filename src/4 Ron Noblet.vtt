1
00:00:4.885 --> 00:00:6.837
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Hey, Welcome back.

2
00:00:6.837 --> 00:00:7.952
- We're going to start up.

3
00:00:7.952 --> 00:00:11.976
- We’re going to do a module on youth violence and gangs.

4
00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:15.353
- We’re going to talk a little bit about the transnational aspects of gangs.

5
00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.475
- Some of what's happened in LA historically.

6
00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:22.561
- And Ron Noblet is going to help walk us through it.

7
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.257
- He's one of the revered experts on gangs.

8
00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:27.887
- I was originally introduced to him.

9
00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:32.558
- He was referred to as the godfather of gang intervention

10
00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:36.745
- and he's definitely lived up to that title.

11
00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.063
- But Ron, you're always interested in some really interesting things.

12
00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:46.23
- Tell me a little bit about what's happening in LA with gangs,

13
00:00:46.23 --> 00:00:47.696
- with groups, with cliques.

14
00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:49.645
- How are things settling out?

15
00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.134
- Where's the power?

16
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.745
- And what do we really need to be thinking about

17
00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.904
- from the perspective of criminal justice

18
00:00:55.904 --> 00:01:0.328
- when we study that at here in LA?

19
00:01:0.328 --> 00:01:2.265
- Ron Noblet: Good question.

20
00:01:2.265 --> 00:01:5.360
- I think LA is in a holding pattern right now

21
00:01:5.360 --> 00:01:6.611
- in a number of ways.

22
00:01:6.611 --> 00:01:10.599
- The city seems to be,

23
00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:12.739
- this is from my point of view,

24
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.283
- the city seems to be frozen in a state of inactivity

25
00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:17.92
- at the mayoral level,

26
00:01:17.92 --> 00:01:20.387
- at the councilmanic level,

27
00:01:20.387 --> 00:01:21.887
- at the GRYD level.

28
00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:26.851
- There's a lot of talk about stuff going on behind the scenes,

29
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.75
- but not really.

30
00:01:27.75 --> 00:01:33.462
- A change that I see directly that deals with intervention and the dealing with gang members.

31
00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:36.976
- And I've seen this in other areas.

32
00:01:36.976 --> 00:
- Once the intervention helped police to lower the level of violence to a certain point,

33
00: --> 00:01:49.647
- the people in control started seeing or acknowledging

34
00:01:49.647 --> 00:01:54.782
- that the people who are capable of lowering the level of violence

35
00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:58.337
- are not nice people to deal with in City Hall.

36
00:01:58.337 --> 00:02:0.233
- And they don’t dress nice and they don't talk nice.

37
00:02:0.233 --> 00:02:6.923
- And so I see more and more encouraging the hiring of more acceptable types of people

38
00:02:6.923 --> 00:02:10.093
- who are truly less capable of dealing with violence.

39
00:02:10.093 --> 00:02:15.301
- And I don't see another open mindedness

40
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:20.717
- of hiring hardcore guys until there is a true spike in violence.

41
00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:26.858
- But overall, the level of violence in LA is down

42
00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:29.299
- to historical low levels in the 50s.

43
00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.246
- With some minor spikes in the Vermont corridor

44
00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:39.346
- and and a lot of uncounted violence going on in East LA.

45
00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:41.026
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: What’s happening in East LA?

46
00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:43.544
- Oh and can you also just explain what GRYD is?

47
00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:51.544
- Ron Noblet: Gang Reduction Youth see GRYD, Gang Reduction Youth...

48
00:02:51.544 --> 00:02:52.527
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Development.

49
00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:53.739
- Ron Noblet: Development.

50
00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.817
- It's in the it's in the mayor's office.

51
00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:56.770
- It’s an independent,

52
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.733
- not an independent,

53
00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:4.515
- but it's a separate group that was put together in 2008

54
00:03:4.515 --> 00:03:12.540
- but with some pressure from a woman by the name of Connie Rice,

55
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.724
- working with the then mayor, Villaraigosa.

56
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:25.020
- And this the GRYD is a unit which monies from the city go through here

57
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.986
- to particular areas

58
00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:30.233
- that have been measured as having high violence

59
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:39.075
- rather than unequal amount going to every single one of the fifteen councilmanic districts.

60
00:03:39.075 --> 00:03:40.132
- There's more.

61
00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:42.008
- It helps to have it more specific.

62
00:03:42.008 --> 00:03:43.980
- That's basically GRYD.

63
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.592
- They also do some measurements.

64
00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.113
- They also do some training.

65
00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:48.769
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: All right.

66
00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.739
- And tell tell me about what’s what's happening in the city

67
00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.983
- with the things that we care about with violence,

68
00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.322
- intimidation, some other things like that.

69
00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:59.592
- You're saying we're at historic lows,

70
00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:2.616
- but there are some areas that are still of concern in the city.

71
00:04:2.616 --> 00:04:10.522
- Ron Noblet: That will happen as long as we have the inequitablities of poverty,

72
00:04:10.522 --> 00:04:18.939
- of poor schools, of police that have not quite got the idea

73
00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.543
- that you don’t brutalize people and people are not animals.

74
00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:28.120
- But those are long term tasks to work on.

75
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.761
- What's happening within the violence world is a breakdown

76
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:39.122
- of the historical gangs that are based on geographic lights.

77
00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:42.055
- That was more so Mexican

78
00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:45.579
- or Mexican American or Chicano than it was with black.

79
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:49.577
- Blacks historically have had to move out of their neighborhoods

80
00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:50.644
- more often than not,

81
00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:54.947
- because they weren't really allowed to have their own geographic areas.

82
00:04:54.947 --> 00:05:1.504
- So in that breakdown of fighting for turf

83
00:05:1.504 --> 00:05:4.754
- there has been for a number of reasons

84
00:05:4.754 --> 00:05:7.507
- : One is the use of the Iphone

85
00:05:7.507 --> 00:05:18.086
- and another is the is the increased ability to move over long over long distances instantly.

86
00:05:18.086 --> 00:05:23.257
- The historic large gangs that fight each other

87
00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:26.502
- are now being broken down into cliques

88
00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:32.322
- and more specified types of groups.

89
00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:37.670
- For instance, you'll see groups that are based on get together just to burglarize.

90
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.105
- Other groups just to do arm robberies.

91
00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:43.995
- Other groups deal with sheer drugs.

92
00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:47.428
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Between between gangs or between cliques?

93
00:05:47.428 --> 00:05:48.605
- Ron Noblet: Internalized in the gangs.

94
00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:56.230
- And in some places, you see guys reaching across their own gang to another gang member

95
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.759
- and they'll get together to do a particular crime.

96
00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:2.163
- And then they'll go and then they'll split

97
00:06:2.163 --> 00:06:4.685
- after it's over and go back to their their own turfs.

98
00:06:4.685 --> 00:06:7.105
- You see that a lot across the nation now more and more.

99
00:06:7.105 --> 00:06:10.471
- As the leaderships are taken out,

100
00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:13.120
- there's a breakdown to the next level.

101
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.394
- And the more the leadership is taken out,

102
00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:16.877
- the more chaos reigns.

103
00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:23.141
- This same type of wrongheaded thinking

104
00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:25.973
- has been taking place in the Middle East

105
00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:28.180
- for years and you could see how effective that is.

106
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.761
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Right.

107
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:34.074
- Ron Noblet: Cutting the head off only increases the level of violence.

108
00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:36.872
- You also see it with the cartels in Mexico.

109
00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:39.483
- Cutting their head off increases the level of violence,

110
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:45.389
- increases the number of individuals fighting for power and fighting for control

111
00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:47.791
- of the drug trade or the gun trade or the slave trade.

112
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:48.723
- Whatever we call it.

113
00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:54.774
- And I prefer slave trade to this human trafficking stuff because it's basically slavery.

114
00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:55.988
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Right?

115
00:06:55.988 --> 00:06:56.139
- Yeah.

116
00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:57.288
- Now that's really interesting.

117
00:06:57.288 --> 00:07:1.906
- You brought up some of these different areas that are experiencing similar trends

118
00:07:1.906 --> 00:07:5.786
- and something you and I have talked a little bit about

119
00:07:5.786 --> 00:07:8.365
- and started to sort of try to make some connections

120
00:07:8.365 --> 00:07:15.946
- with is this idea of the correlation between repression or brutal repression and radicalization of youth.

121
00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:23.747
- We talked about it in Egypt with the sort of recruiting of ISIS that's happening in the prisons there.

122
00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:30.314
- And you agreed you thought that there was some connection with what's happening in the Northern Triangle

123
00:07:30.314 --> 00:07:33.964
- and maybe even in the streets here in the United States?

124
00:07:33.964 --> 00:07:36.5
- What are some of the similarities in that?

125
00:07:36.5 --> 00:07:45.055
- Police or government repression of individuals and sort of pushing people into doing things they wouldn't do otherwise.

126
00:07:45.055 --> 00:07:46.100
- How does that work?

127
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.995
- Ron Noblet: I like the question.

128
00:07:49.995 --> 00:07:52.608
- Interesting thing is our government,

129
00:07:52.608 --> 00:07:55.970
- you are not really radicalized

130
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.446
- if you're not a Muslim.

131
00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:7.389
- So exactly the same conditions that turn a person that happens to be a Muslim into a radical,

132
00:08:7.389 --> 00:08:10.367
- into a person full of rage and hatred,

133
00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:11.930
- making one lash out.

134
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.641
- It's the exact same thing that turns a non-Muslim into a gang member

135
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.245
- and makes him full of rage and hate and making want him to lash out.

136
00:08:20.245 --> 00:08:24.064
- But because the money's are only into in a certain area,

137
00:08:24.064 --> 00:08:26.795
- the government says only this is radicalization.

138
00:08:26.795 --> 00:08:31.170
- Therefore, the same, put two guys in a prison cell,

139
00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:32.643
- one is a Muslim,

140
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:33.423
- one is a Christian.

141
00:08:33.423 --> 00:08:35.118
- They go through the same things,

142
00:08:35.118 --> 00:08:36.831
- they go through the same repressions,

143
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.038
- they grew up the same way.

144
00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:39.799
- They both become radicalized

145
00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.850
- in the sense of full of hatred and full of blame

146
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.073
- and willing to go out and do something about it.

147
00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:47.735
- The guy who is a Muslim is considered a radicalized Muslim

148
00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.525
- and there’ll be money is going down to deal with that.

149
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:51.985
- The other is just a gang member get rid of him.

150
00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:54.547
- Or ignore him until he does something.

151
00:08:54.547 --> 00:09:1.981
- You see this taking place to a huge extent in the Triangle.

152
00:09:1.981 --> 00:09:3.432
- In the Northern Triangle,

153
00:09:3.432 --> 00:09:4.149
- which is Guatemala,

154
00:09:4.149 --> 00:09:5.581
- Salvador and Honduras,

155
00:09:5.581 --> 00:09:23.023
- is that the police and the military in those three countries in conjunction with these death squads that make make made up of either police and or army and or rich people who tend to be of lighter skin.

156
00:09:23.023 --> 00:09:28.327
- They count on repression to keep the gang members down.

157
00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:31.369
- And what happens is the number of gang members go up.

158
00:09:31.369 --> 00:09:33.596
- The violence goes up.

159
00:09:33.596 --> 00:09:38.903
- The youth become so radicalized that they become savage.

160
00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:42.654
- And what we see taking place is freaking out the people in the East Coast

161
00:09:42.654 --> 00:09:51.143
- and up in Long Island is just simply a logical extension of what happens when you treat people like in a savage way.

162
00:09:51.143 --> 00:09:52.235
- They become savages.

163
00:09:52.235 --> 00:09:54.928
- It happens everywhere,

164
00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.000
- like in LA.

165
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:0.720
- There was a long hatred between police and gang members.

166
00:10:0.720 --> 00:10:2.860
- A mutual hate.

167
00:10:2.860 --> 00:10:5.772
- Well, we've been working on it for more than a decade now

168
00:10:5.772 --> 00:10:6.914
- in a number of ways.

169
00:10:6.914 --> 00:10:10.246
- So that there is still no love fest,

170
00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:18.476
- but both sides have learned that at least we can work in harmony

171
00:10:18.476 --> 00:10:23.115
- in separate and parallel lines to focus on the violence problem.

172
00:10:23.115 --> 00:10:25.940
- And the tension has gone down.

173
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:32.898
- And in areas where it has been GRYD outlined we have intervention workers focusing.

174
00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:35.610
- There's less violence towards police.

175
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:41.160
- As opposed to an area outside where there is no intervention workers.

176
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.202
- The same thing should happen in every city

177
00:10:45.202 --> 00:10:50.971
- or in every area where people learn to work in harmony

178
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:52.307
- rather than against each other.

179
00:10:52.307 --> 00:10:59.374
- Harmony is usually decided by police

180
00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:4.409
- and it means more often than not “do what we say.

181
00:11:4.409 --> 00:11:8.293
- Give us information that we want and we'll work in harmony.”

182
00:11:8.293 --> 00:11:9.706
- That's not the way it works.

183
00:11:9.706 --> 00:11:13.054
- I think that police should be worked with all the time.

184
00:11:13.054 --> 00:11:15.779
- I do not think that a civilian,

185
00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:18.038
- well, I take it back.

186
00:11:18.038 --> 00:11:25.783
- A civilian should give the police as much information as they can on any anything that takes place.

187
00:11:25.783 --> 00:11:27.216
- I think that's that's righteous.

188
00:11:27.216 --> 00:11:30.996
- That's the way the government is supposed to act.

189
00:11:30.996 --> 00:11:33.293
- But a person who has been an ex-gang member,

190
00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:37.643
- or who is who is an intervention worker,

191
00:11:37.643 --> 00:11:43.648
- if they act like a regular citizen to give the police information

192
00:11:43.648 --> 00:11:46.085
- is to set them up for being killed.

193
00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:49.513
- Which is why we say, do not give the police information.

194
00:11:49.513 --> 00:11:52.365
- Let them do the job so that you can work with guys.

195
00:11:52.365 --> 00:12:0.389
- So that the guys do not retaliate and the whole emphasis of intervention is non-retaliation.

196
00:12:0.389 --> 00:12:3.052
- Try to talk to guys into not seeking revenge.

197
00:12:3.052 --> 00:12:4.426
- With police,

198
00:12:4.426 --> 00:12:5.720
- it is do your job.

199
00:12:5.720 --> 00:12:10.975
- Specifically do it fair and target who you're after.

200
00:12:10.975 --> 00:12:15.958
- Don't throw a blank attack on anyone.

201
00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.863
- A problem that we're having in El Salvador

202
00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:22.857
- is the police are reaching the same sort of hatred toward the gang members

203
00:12:22.857 --> 00:12:24.462
- the gang member has for the police.

204
00:12:24.462 --> 00:12:25.480
- So it's war.

205
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.513
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Right.

206
00:12:26.513 --> 00:12:29.945
- So tell me about here in the states

207
00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:35.105
- there are a few different approaches towards violence reduction

208
00:12:35.105 --> 00:12:36.956
- with gang involved youth.

209
00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:39.423
- So you have taken the Kennedy approach,

210
00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:41.062
- National Network for Safe Communities.

211
00:12:41.062 --> 00:12:42.595
- You’ve got Gary Slutkin in Chicago.

212
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.267
- His Cure Violence model.

213
00:12:44.267 --> 00:12:45.916
- You have LA,

214
00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:53.592
- the LA model over here and sometimes called GRYD by some.

215
00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:58.125
- But tell me about the difference in approaches and how you guys.

216
00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:0.155
- Am I using the right terminology?

217
00:13:0.155 --> 00:13:1.902
- Ron Noblet: Its close.

218
00:13:1.902 --> 00:13:5.677
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Who is doing what and what seems to be working best?

219
00:13:5.677 --> 00:13:9.549
- Cause I know that you're working with people from across the country.

220
00:13:9.549 --> 00:13:12.205
- And you get exposure to a lot of these different approaches.

221
00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:14.339
- What's working best and what are they called?

222
00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:18.280
- Ron Noblet: I think the simplest way is that the Kennedy model,

223
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.773
- which which was created in Boston,

224
00:13:20.773 --> 00:13:29.505
- is used in New York with Kennedy coming out of the Law school in New York.

225
00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:35.173
- The Kennedy model has an emphasis on police.

226
00:13:35.173 --> 00:13:38.514
- It's basically a carrot and stick approach

227
00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:42.600
- where so called leaders are brought together,

228
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.859
- sat down and told this is what will happen to you if you continue your crime.

229
00:13:47.859 --> 00:13:51.024
- And if you don't continue crime,

230
00:13:51.024 --> 00:13:52.316
- you get all these goodies.

231
00:13:52.316 --> 00:13:54.522
- That's a very simplistic way of putting it.

232
00:13:54.522 --> 00:13:56.150
- There's that model.

233
00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:1.687
- The Slutkin model which comes out of Chicago is broader,

234
00:14:1.687 --> 00:14:10.177
- in that, it basically says that the workers will have nothing

235
00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:11.172
- to do with the police.

236
00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:12.635
- Do not trust the police.

237
00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:14.554
- We will not deal with the police at all.

238
00:14:14.554 --> 00:14:20.053
- And that they are quasi independent groups.

239
00:14:20.053 --> 00:14:26.870
- The Slutkin model does not give very much support to the intervention workers.

240
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.149
- Basically, if you are in trouble on something,

241
00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:30.004
- you're on your own.

242
00:14:30.004 --> 00:14:34.409
- A positive thing about that approach

243
00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:46.389
- is the fact that it uses a public health assessment

244
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:49.030
- on how people are and how our community is looked at.

245
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.400
- The weaknesses of it was a public.

246
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.692
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: By that you mean like his epidemiological background,

247
00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:55.614
- looking at diseases and how they spread?

248
00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:56.811
- Ron Noblet: Right right.

249
00:14:56.811 --> 00:15:1.673
- The disease would be the violence here.

250
00:15:1.673 --> 00:15:9.083
- The weakness is that gang area or a violent area is not is not a disease area.

251
00:15:9.083 --> 00:15:12.256
- It doesn't, people don't know how to deal with violence.

252
00:15:12.256 --> 00:15:14.355
- Both are models.

253
00:15:14.355 --> 00:15:20.120
- The Kennedy model is good in the sense of if you have an area

254
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:26.841
- where you have plenty of stick and plenty of carrot

255
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:29.278
- and you can get the real shot callers,

256
00:15:29.278 --> 00:15:33.509
- you have a chance to put the level of violence down.

257
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:39.238
- The LA approach consciously does not use the model concept.

258
00:15:39.238 --> 00:15:42.812
- We take what we think is strong with the Kennedy,

259
00:15:42.812 --> 00:15:45.731
- strong with the Slutkin

260
00:15:45.731 --> 00:15:48.293
- and then what we learned in the LA approach

261
00:15:48.293 --> 00:15:50.236
- is that intervention,

262
00:15:50.236 --> 00:15:54.692
- prevention, reentry, targeted policing

263
00:15:54.692 --> 00:15:57.852
- all have to work together in conjunction

264
00:15:57.852 --> 00:16:1.663
- with governmental entities to approach an area

265
00:16:1.663 --> 00:16:5.850
- that is unique in and of itself and do what is effective.

266
00:16:5.850 --> 00:16:9.630
- That's why we resist talking about a model.

267
00:16:9.630 --> 00:16:13.707
- The weakness of the Kennedy model

268
00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:19.567
- is that there's not that many areas that can give a strong carrot.

269
00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:22.078
- So they emphasize the stick,

270
00:16:22.078 --> 00:16:23.282
- number one.

271
00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:24.289
- Number

272
00:16:24.289 --> 00:16:25.996
- two, the real shot callers,

273
00:16:25.996 --> 00:16:33.489
- the real tough guys are not gonna come and sit down and take a bunch of guff from police and be told like this,

274
00:16:33.489 --> 00:16:35.154
- and then we're going to do this to you.

275
00:16:35.154 --> 00:16:39.409
- So probation officers who receive a lot of pressure to go out and grab some guys.

276
00:16:39.409 --> 00:16:41.368
- They get guys who are already on probation,

277
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:44.065
- already on parole who they have control over already.

278
00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:48.797
- Ok, come and sit in and listen to the police tell you how how tough they’re gonna treat you.

279
00:16:48.797 --> 00:16:55.015
- So it becomes a joke in almost every city that we’ve been in when we talk about that approach.

280
00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.073
- There's laughing that takes place

281
00:16:57.073 --> 00:17:1.533
- or this is more set up to get guys shot than it is to help anybody else and that.

282
00:17:1.533 --> 00:17:4.493
- With the Slutkin approach,

283
00:17:4.493 --> 00:17:11.799
- we learn in LA and we preach this that you cannot ignore

284
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.948
- the police or be hostile to the police.

285
00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:16.512
- I mean, they’re there as much as anybody else.

286
00:17:16.512 --> 00:17:18.856
- They know the gang members as well as you do.

287
00:17:18.856 --> 00:17:26.340
- There has to be some sort of mutual respect developed between the intervention community

288
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.991
- and the police community

289
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:30.576
- so that they work at least in tandem

290
00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:32.594
- to focus on the level of violence.

291
00:17:32.594 --> 00:17:34.154
- That is the LA approach.

292
00:17:34.154 --> 00:17:42.357
- Their strengths and weaknesses with the other two that we don't we don't touch either of them.

293
00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:43.255
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Interesting.

294
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:48.319
- Yeah, that's really interesting on how the approach works.

295
00:17:48.319 --> 00:17:52.994
- What are the tools that you use when you.

296
00:17:52.994 --> 00:17:57.670
- What's the triggering event for you guys to get a call?

297
00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.616
- What is there?

298
00:17:58.616 --> 00:17:59.516
- Is there a shooting?

299
00:17:59.516 --> 00:18:3.470
- They say hey we got a brother over here and here is the sister,

300
00:18:3.470 --> 00:18:4.493
- here is the parents,

301
00:18:4.493 --> 00:18:5.325
- do you?

302
00:18:5.325 --> 00:18:9.198
- What sort of information to the people that you interact with or that you work with?

303
00:18:9.198 --> 00:18:12.829
- How do they get involved and what's the introduction

304
00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:14.289
- like this guy's credible?

305
00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:17.257
- He's been in the life

306
00:18:17.257 --> 00:18:17.615
- before.

307
00:18:17.615 --> 00:18:19.648
- Like, how does that introduction happen?

308
00:18:19.648 --> 00:18:20.993
- How do the people come together?

309
00:18:20.993 --> 00:18:27.041
- Ron Noblet: Let’s simply put this in three phases.

310
00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:28.926
- In the first phase,

311
00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:31.234
- you work with families.

312
00:18:31.234 --> 00:18:33.444
- You work with the community.

313
00:18:33.444 --> 00:18:38.202
- And you earn their respect by doing favors

314
00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:40.567
- by helping them in any way you can.

315
00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:43.538
- And a lot of emphasis is put on the females,

316
00:18:43.538 --> 00:18:44.961
- the wives,

317
00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:47.036
- the daughters etcetera etcetera.

318
00:18:47.036 --> 00:18:51.157
- The middle level is the crisis mode.

319
00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:57.223
- The crisis is when somebody has been shot and active violence has taken place.

320
00:18:57.223 --> 00:18:59.272
- Calls go up.

321
00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:2.025
- The police get the report.

322
00:19:2.025 --> 00:19:6.393
- Automatically, information goes out to all intervention workers.

323
00:19:6.393 --> 00:19:9.442
- And then those who work in that area are called to it.

324
00:19:9.442 --> 00:19:11.138
- But more often than not,

325
00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:17.220
- the intervention workers will get calls from the community way before

326
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.141
- the police get any kind of calls and can send out that information.

327
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:26.405
- The third aspect after the crisis is maintenance.

328
00:19:26.405 --> 00:19:28.218
- You have dealt with the crisis.

329
00:19:28.218 --> 00:19:32.054
- You have lowered the crisis heat level.

330
00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:36.800
- But people, especially for the people who have been from the side who have been attacked,

331
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.096
- they have to be worked with consistently so as not to want revenge.

332
00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:43.510
- In the six different areas

333
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.361
- of the six different triggers of violence,

334
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:48.913
- revenge is the most difficult to deal with.

335
00:19:48.913 --> 00:19:53.173
- It is the hardest to put out and more often than not it has to burn out.

336
00:19:53.173 --> 00:19:58.805
- And so we emphasize to get with the side that has been attacked

337
00:19:58.805 --> 00:20:3.904
- so that the revenge step does not begin and that you keep guys talking.

338
00:20:3.904 --> 00:20:6.292
- The people who are most effective

339
00:20:6.292 --> 00:20:8.268
- at that are ex-gang members.

340
00:20:8.268 --> 00:20:12.887
- And people who have been trained to deal effectively once they have got out of the life.

341
00:20:12.887 --> 00:20:15.563
- We have heavy screening for these guys,

342
00:20:15.563 --> 00:20:18.740
- because in the beginning a lot of them were on both sides.

343
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.75
- We have to get rid of them,

344
00:20:19.75 --> 00:20:22.031
- and they have to be screened out.

345
00:20:22.031 --> 00:20:26.097
- A good way to get rid of them is simply ask the community “What's this guy”

346
00:20:26.097 --> 00:20:28.152
- and the community always knows before anybody else does.

347
00:20:28.152 --> 00:20:30.435
- And so you can ask them those kind of questions.

348
00:20:30.435 --> 00:20:37.189
- In building that in areas like in Central America,

349
00:20:37.189 --> 00:20:45.008
- where gang members are not allowed to even to be in an intervention and to work with a gang member could get you arrested,

350
00:20:45.008 --> 00:20:46.987
- it's literally counterproductive

351
00:20:46.987 --> 00:20:48.931
- in dealing with the problem of violence.

352
00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:51.888
- But the three areas before the crisis,

353
00:20:51.888 --> 00:20:52.792
- crisis,

354
00:20:52.792 --> 00:20:53.924
- after the crisis,

355
00:20:53.924 --> 00:20:56.630
- whatever the terminology they want to use for it,

356
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:3.378
- requires people who have spent a good deal of time

357
00:21:3.378 --> 00:21:6.806
- in the community working with people and earning their trust.

358
00:21:6.806 --> 00:21:10.015
- Everything is based upon personal relationships

359
00:21:10.015 --> 00:21:10.798
- and trust.

360
00:21:10.798 --> 00:21:13.445
- Everything is based on personal relationships and trust.

361
00:21:13.445 --> 00:21:15.708
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Okay.

362
00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:20.205
- You guys are working in Central America as well.

363
00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:24.921
- How do you develop that same level of trust

364
00:21:24.921 --> 00:21:30.729
- with a network of people that you can that you can work with to get them to deal with similar situations?

365
00:21:30.729 --> 00:21:35.704
- Ron Noblet: In the last couple of years,

366
00:21:35.704 --> 00:21:42.458
- our team has been brought in by AID

367
00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:46.942
- and creative to focus on two colonias

368
00:21:46.942 --> 00:21:49.919
- and two cities in El Salvador.

369
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:53.730
- We're not allowed to use ex-gang members

370
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.438
- because of the laws of that country.

371
00:21:55.438 --> 00:21:58.006
- And so the people who have been recruited,

372
00:21:58.006 --> 00:22:0.181
- or given to us to deal with

373
00:22:0.181 --> 00:22:2.983
- (we've been allowed to do some screening out)

374
00:22:2.983 --> 00:22:6.211
- are people who have grown up in these communities,

375
00:22:6.211 --> 00:22:9.978
- but are non-gang members.

376
00:22:9.978 --> 00:22:12.652
- In one community in one..

377
00:22:12.652 --> 00:22:17.261
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Who are who are these people who are interested in being in this line of work?

378
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:19.703
- And they're interested and have they been trained?

379
00:22:19.703 --> 00:22:24.960
- Or they just happen to have the network of picking one community?

380
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.432
- Ron Noblet: In one community, I won't give you names,

381
00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:36.021
- but in one of the communities these guys have been working in targeted community for a while.

382
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:46.795
- Basically like are people who work on ambulances.

383
00:22:46.795 --> 00:22:47.807
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: OK.

384
00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:50.155
- Ron Noblet: Guys who would go to pick up the bodies,

385
00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:51.810
- will take care of people who've been shot.

386
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:52.132
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: First responders.

387
00:22:52.132 --> 00:22:53.294
- Ron Noblet: First responders.

388
00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:54.445
- All that type of people.

389
00:22:54.445 --> 00:22:59.063
- So they are they have developed a sense of trust in the community.

390
00:22:59.063 --> 00:23:2.268
- So it's just a step to them to deal with the gang members.

391
00:23:2.268 --> 00:23:4.125
- They’re more advanced.

392
00:23:4.125 --> 00:23:6.606
- When we train them, they understand what we're talking about.

393
00:23:6.606 --> 00:23:9.417
- The people in the other community,

394
00:23:9.417 --> 00:23:11.039
- there weren’t anybody like that there.

395
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:17.471
- And so an organization that we would call a prevention oriented,

396
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:20.739
- which had a fairly strong infrastructure

397
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:23.460
- was picked not by us but given to us,

398
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.450
- and we will pick the type of guys we want.

399
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.127
- So we screen them as best we could.

400
00:23:31.127 --> 00:23:32.284
- And then they hire,

401
00:23:32.284 --> 00:23:34.573
- they choose who they are gonna hire.

402
00:23:34.573 --> 00:23:36.036
- And so we're working on them.

403
00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:38.577
- They are behind in the sense

404
00:23:38.577 --> 00:23:42.463
- because they wanted to go out and start doing what an intervention worker does.

405
00:23:42.463 --> 00:23:43.376
- And we said,

406
00:23:43.376 --> 00:23:45.854
- "wait, develop relationships.

407
00:23:45.854 --> 00:23:48.048
- Do little favors for people,

408
00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:51.036
- so we have to hold the ones back to keep them from getting hurt.

409
00:23:51.036 --> 00:23:52.162
- While the others,

410
00:23:52.162 --> 00:23:54.653
- we are able to support more and more.

411
00:23:54.653 --> 00:24:1.294
- The idea of helping people for the sake of helping people

412
00:24:1.294 --> 00:24:4.837
- is usually understood best by people in the religious community.

413
00:24:4.837 --> 00:24:6.855
- We’re starting to train people in religious community

414
00:24:6.855 --> 00:24:7.744
- to do that right now.

415
00:24:7.744 --> 00:24:13.730
- But also trying to get them to say helping people and proselytizing are two separate things.

416
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.506
- And guys might resent your proselytizing

417
00:24:15.506 --> 00:24:17.546
- when you should be just helping.

418
00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:19.635
- So that has to be worked on.

419
00:24:19.635 --> 00:24:25.144
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Is there a strong group inside

420
00:24:25.144 --> 00:24:29.422
- of the faith based community in Central America

421
00:24:29.422 --> 00:24:31.923
- that want to actually be active and involved in this kind of work?

422
00:24:31.923 --> 00:24:33.846
- Ron Noblet: Yes there is, yes there is.

423
00:24:33.846 --> 00:24:41.119
- And we've been bringing groups of people from El Salvador over here as it is.

424
00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:42.744
- There are six thousand nuns

425
00:24:42.744 --> 00:24:47.249
- in El Salvador and nuns are hardcore.

426
00:24:47.249 --> 00:24:50.776
- so we have been doing everything we can to get the nuns involved in this.

427
00:24:50.776 --> 00:24:52.191
- And many of the pastors.

428
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:56.843
- There is a very high percentage of charismatic and evangelical

429
00:24:56.843 --> 00:25:1.557
- in El Salvador right now.

430
00:25:1.557 --> 00:25:6.758
- So hopefully a combination of the Catholic Church

431
00:25:6.758 --> 00:25:12.557
- with the evangelicals and the charismatics can really be helpful.

432
00:25:12.557 --> 00:25:20.691
- The difference is that the part of the Catholic Church

433
00:25:20.691 --> 00:25:23.351
- that would be the most effective

434
00:25:23.351 --> 00:25:26.219
- for us got taken out when Romero was assassinated.

435
00:25:26.219 --> 00:25:27.310
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Oh!

436
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:34.865
- Ron Noblet: And so the new hierarchy is a little more conservative.

437
00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:36.073
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Gotcha.

438
00:25:36.073 --> 00:25:38.116
- Ron Noblet: With evangelicals and the charismatics,

439
00:25:38.116 --> 00:25:40.397
- they are hot to go.

440
00:25:40.397 --> 00:25:42.431
- I will give you an example.

441
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:43.301
- Few weeks ago,

442
00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:47.308
- we had a group of pastors

443
00:25:47.308 --> 00:25:49.155
- over in a training.

444
00:25:49.155 --> 00:25:51.836
- And one of the pastors was very quiet.

445
00:25:51.836 --> 00:25:54.830
- On the second day at lunch,

446
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:55.923
- he and I were sitting across.

447
00:25:55.923 --> 00:26:1.775
- And he told me that the previous week his son,

448
00:26:1.775 --> 00:26:3.741
- who had just finished med school

449
00:26:3.741 --> 00:26:7.954
- and was ready to start his internship,

450
00:26:7.954 --> 00:26:11.489
- had been playing football.

451
00:26:11.489 --> 00:26:12.932
- We call it soccer.

452
00:26:12.932 --> 00:26:14.707
- With four friends,

453
00:26:14.707 --> 00:26:16.855
- they went to one of the local stores

454
00:26:16.855 --> 00:26:20.093
- before they were going to go home to buy some pops.

455
00:26:20.093 --> 00:26:22.997
- Soft drinks.

456
00:26:22.997 --> 00:26:24.797
- They were outside a store,

457
00:26:24.797 --> 00:26:26.289
- a car came by, it stopped.

458
00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:27.806
- Guy got out,

459
00:26:27.806 --> 00:26:30.329
- two guys got out with automatic weapons

460
00:26:30.329 --> 00:26:31.286
- and just sprayed them all.

461
00:26:31.286 --> 00:26:33.127
- Killed his son,

462
00:26:33.127 --> 00:26:34.289
- killed another guy,

463
00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:37.075
- wounded two and one ran.

464
00:26:37.075 --> 00:26:40.123
- He got the call.

465
00:26:40.123 --> 00:26:43.115
- And he and his wife rushed over there

466
00:26:43.115 --> 00:26:45.472
- and his son had been hit in the head.

467
00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:48.883
- They took him to the hospital.

468
00:26:48.883 --> 00:26:52.364
- The doctor said “no way”.

469
00:26:52.364 --> 00:26:54.003
- So he was dead the next day.

470
00:26:54.003 --> 00:26:55.288
- Turns out,

471
00:26:55.288 --> 00:27:1.320
- the gang had got the word that one of them was snitching.

472
00:27:1.320 --> 00:27:7.083
- And so the gang decided to shoot them all

473
00:27:7.083 --> 00:27:9.660
- to make sure that they got the guy who was a snitch.

474
00:27:9.660 --> 00:27:11.355
- So they killed the snitch

475
00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:13.105
- and they killed his son

476
00:27:13.105 --> 00:27:17.147
- who had done nothing and just wanted to help people.

477
00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:23.083
- He had then said he had told his wife.

478
00:27:23.083 --> 00:27:26.987
- I can't go to LA for this.

479
00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:28.564
- I just can't do it.

480
00:27:28.564 --> 00:27:34.701
- And his wife said maybe you will learn something there that will make sure you can bring back and this won’t happen again.

481
00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:37.284
- That was eleven days before we spoke.

482
00:27:37.284 --> 00:27:38.932
- Nine days before we spoke,

483
00:27:38.932 --> 00:27:45.025
- he buried his son and he came to our training.

484
00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:48.105
- And he said he was glad he had come.

485
00:27:48.105 --> 00:27:49.838
- But that's the dedication of these people.

486
00:27:49.838 --> 00:27:51.323
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Amazing!

487
00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:54.740
- Thanks for sharing that.

488
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.663
- So this is a public policy group.

489
00:27:58.663 --> 00:28:1.160
- These are students who are learning public policy.

490
00:28:1.160 --> 00:28:6.855
- What can the world of public policy offer to the work that you're doing?

491
00:28:6.855 --> 00:28:8.317
- Whether it's research,

492
00:28:8.317 --> 00:28:11.681
- helping to make sure that laws or institutions are adjusted

493
00:28:11.681 --> 00:28:12.712
- in a certain way,

494
00:28:12.712 --> 00:28:15.458
- bringing some sort of understanding out into the community

495
00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:18.279
- to make this work is easier to do.

496
00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:21.458
- What what can the public policy community do to help you guys?

497
00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:22.821
- Ron Noblet: Everything.

498
00:28:22.821 --> 00:28:24.175
- Everything.

499
00:28:24.175 --> 00:28:29.720
- We have two attorneys at Urban Peace.

500
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.163
- That's their whole job.

501
00:28:32.163 --> 00:28:34.221
- We have a half a dozen other people.

502
00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:35.647
- That's their whole job.

503
00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.320
- You focus on policy.

504
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.868
- You change the policies.

505
00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:40.617
- You change what takes place.

506
00:28:40.617 --> 00:28:43.535
- You can help deal and alleviate these problems of violence.

507
00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:49.371
- One of the things they're working on right now is these rules

508
00:28:49.371 --> 00:28:51.819
- where anybody can be put on the gang.

509
00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:53.816
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Injunction?

510
00:28:53.816 --> 00:28:56.938
- Ron Noblet: Well, a gang injunction is one thing that we will be working on.

511
00:28:56.938 --> 00:28:59.096
- Anybody could be put on gang injunction.

512
00:28:59.096 --> 00:29:0.847
- You and I grew up together and we're brothers.

513
00:29:0.847 --> 00:29:1.905
- You're on the gang.

514
00:29:1.905 --> 00:29:3.142
- If I'm messing with you,

515
00:29:3.142 --> 00:29:4.276
- they can get me.

516
00:29:4.276 --> 00:29:5.300
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Yeah yeah.

517
00:29:5.300 --> 00:29:6.201
- Ron Noblet: If I'm just talking to you,

518
00:29:6.201 --> 00:29:8.194
- they can get me or put you away.

519
00:29:8.194 --> 00:29:9.086
- That's the injunction.

520
00:29:9.086 --> 00:29:12.893
- Another thing is from field reports.

521
00:29:12.893 --> 00:29:15.444
- Guys, or say this guy is in a gang,

522
00:29:15.444 --> 00:29:18.229
- field goes in, goes into the state gang.

523
00:29:18.229 --> 00:29:21.215
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Hard to get yourself off of that list.

524
00:29:21.215 --> 00:29:22.200
- Ron Noblet: Yeah, it's almost impossible.

525
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.515
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Yeah.

526
00:29:22.515 --> 00:29:24.411
- Ron Noblet: We have attorneys working on both.

527
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:26.135
- All of it has to do with policy.

528
00:29:26.135 --> 00:29:28.111
- All of it has to do with policy.

529
00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:31.826
- The policy of selling crack

530
00:29:31.826 --> 00:29:40.955
- gives you a five times harder judgment than just selling cocaine was well intended.

531
00:29:40.955 --> 00:29:43.321
- But look at the monster it created.

532
00:29:43.321 --> 00:29:44.861
- That policy has to change.

533
00:29:44.861 --> 00:29:49.287
- Your students get them through first.

534
00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.721
- And then there's all kinds of policies

535
00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:53.039
- they can work on,

536
00:29:53.039 --> 00:29:59.710
- and I have only become a late believer in the need to change policy.

537
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:0.605
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Yeah,

538
00:30:0.605 --> 00:30:4.859
- it's a great comment and it's a great framework to work through.

539
00:30:4.859 --> 00:30:10.978
- Where do you see things going

540
00:30:10.978 --> 00:30:14.454
- for the world of violence reduction,

541
00:30:14.454 --> 00:30:20.010
- gang intervention next five years in the US?

542
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.851
- Let's start there.

543
00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:32.827
- Ron Noblet: That depends a lot on how effective the current administration is.

544
00:30:32.827 --> 00:30:35.346
- It's continuing to divide people,

545
00:30:35.346 --> 00:30:37.262
- terrify people

546
00:30:37.262 --> 00:30:42.942
- and make it easier to hate.

547
00:30:42.942 --> 00:30:48.361
- People who are afraid can be controlled into learning to hate.

548
00:30:48.361 --> 00:30:51.740
- You can't hate someone you're not afraid of.

549
00:30:51.740 --> 00:31:2.749
- So a lot depends on that and how our nation responds to this period of time.

550
00:31:2.749 --> 00:31:5.121
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: I remember.

551
00:31:5.121 --> 00:31:8.431
- What about our white power gangs

552
00:31:8.431 --> 00:31:11.445
- here in across the country

553
00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:15.906
- and the mayhem they're responsible for?

554
00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:19.420
- Ron Noblet: Since nine one one more than seventy percent of the mass killings

555
00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.009
- and killings that have taken place in groups killing in the United States

556
00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:24.240
- have been done by white power guys.

557
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.692
- But you never hear that.

558
00:31:25.692 --> 00:31:28.301
- You never hear everybody talking about it.

559
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:30.112
- I see them getting increasingly stronger.

560
00:31:30.112 --> 00:31:33.551
- They're driven.

561
00:31:33.551 --> 00:31:36.229
- Well, there's two kinds of white power

562
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:37.318
- that I have seen.

563
00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:39.146
- There's one that is basically anti-black,

564
00:31:39.146 --> 00:31:42.894
- anti-brown anti anti anti based upon fear.

565
00:31:42.894 --> 00:31:43.853
- There's another,

566
00:31:43.853 --> 00:31:46.828
- that's more based upon real white pride

567
00:31:46.828 --> 00:31:49.944
- and they're trying to say white power,

568
00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:52.660
- just like black power was an attempt to say we are somebody.

569
00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.085
- So those are different.

570
00:31:55.085 --> 00:31:57.416
- And I don't think they should be approached

571
00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:2.601
- in the same way that the more virulent type of white power.

572
00:32:2.601 --> 00:32:4.669
- Because there's white pride and there’s white power.

573
00:32:4.669 --> 00:32:8.009
- The white power people talk about white pride,

574
00:32:8.009 --> 00:32:9.576
- but they're more anti.

575
00:32:9.576 --> 00:32:16.154
- The white pride people are trying to get themselves together.

576
00:32:16.154 --> 00:32:17.061
- And what are we,

577
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:21.700
- because they've never had to face the idea of white as a group

578
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:22.624
- or white as a tribe.

579
00:32:22.624 --> 00:32:24.634
- It's just us and then people are talking.

580
00:32:24.634 --> 00:32:26.964
- And all of a sudden there is Oh yeah!

581
00:32:26.964 --> 00:32:27.410
- I am white.

582
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.994
- Oh yeah!

583
00:32:27.994 --> 00:32:29.805
- well, what does it mean to be white?

584
00:32:29.805 --> 00:32:29.876
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Right.

585
00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:31.143
- Ron Noblet: First time I brought it up,

586
00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:34.409
- and I was doing some training at a local college

587
00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:38.932
- and so this was in the late seventies or in the eighties.

588
00:32:38.932 --> 00:32:42.031
- And when I was talking about Asians

589
00:32:42.031 --> 00:32:43.883
- as one thing to this group of teachers.

590
00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:45.398
- Talking about blacks,

591
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:48.486
- talking about brown everything was cool.

592
00:32:48.486 --> 00:32:50.044
- When I started talking about whites,

593
00:32:50.044 --> 00:32:51.161
- the teachers went crazy.

594
00:32:51.161 --> 00:32:52.866
- Why do you have to talk about that?

595
00:32:52.866 --> 00:32:55.971
- Why do you have to bring up all that cultural stuff for?

596
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:57.755
- We don't have a culture.

597
00:32:57.755 --> 00:33:0.459
- The white culture is so dominant.

598
00:33:0.459 --> 00:33:2.161
- How can you see yourself in the mirror?

599
00:33:2.161 --> 00:33:3.760
- Look, how hostile you are!

600
00:33:3.760 --> 00:33:5.568
- And then oh, my God!

601
00:33:5.568 --> 00:33:6.530
- That's what I got to deal with.

602
00:33:6.530 --> 00:33:8.035
- And that's what the country is dealing with right now.

603
00:33:8.035 --> 00:33:12.555
- You have people who are for the first time having question their whiteness.

604
00:33:12.555 --> 00:33:15.315
- I mean it was only about five years ago somebody said,

605
00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:19.019
- Ron you are a you have white,

606
00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:20.499
- was it not white?

607
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:21.900
- A sense of yeah white entitlement.

608
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.905
- What's that mean?

609
00:33:23.905 --> 00:33:26.220
- What is white entitlement?

610
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.143
- And I had no idea.

611
00:33:29.143 --> 00:33:31.093
- And then guy started.

612
00:33:31.093 --> 00:33:33.807
- Have you always been this or has been that?

613
00:33:33.807 --> 00:33:36.126
- I said oh yeah I thought that will put me ahead because I was smart.

614
00:33:36.126 --> 00:33:36.402
- All right.

615
00:33:36.402 --> 00:33:39.108
- And I realized yeah, because I gotta white puss.

616
00:33:39.108 --> 00:33:42.911
- I got a lot of stuff and I got that white.

617
00:33:42.911 --> 00:33:45.768
- It’s not white entitlement so much as white privilege.

618
00:33:45.768 --> 00:33:46.942
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: White privilege.

619
00:33:46.942 --> 00:33:47.442
- Yes.

620
00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:47.817
- Ron Noblet: White privilege and I said okay.

621
00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:50.596
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Yeah absolutely!

622
00:33:50.596 --> 00:33:54.365
- Ron Noblet: Now that I know what it is I will use it more effectively.

623
00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.071
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Well, I think you are hitting,

624
00:33:56.071 --> 00:33:58.123
- I think you are hitting on a really good point which

625
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:1.656
- is, it's hard to see obstacles that are not there.

626
00:34:1.656 --> 00:34:4.974
- So white privilege comes from doors opening

627
00:34:4.974 --> 00:34:5.973
- that you didn't see open for you.

628
00:34:5.973 --> 00:34:7.653
- Ron Noblet: Yeah, least expected.

629
00:34:7.653 --> 00:34:10.565
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: But there are other people who didn't have that door opened.

630
00:34:10.565 --> 00:34:12.438
- And so they see that you are able to walk through it.

631
00:34:12.438 --> 00:34:13.121
- Ron Noblet: Exactly.

632
00:34:13.121 --> 00:34:17.367
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: And so I think it requires communication and a perspective to happen.

633
00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:22.226
- But your point of the radicalized Muslim is a terrorist.

634
00:34:22.226 --> 00:34:25.793
- The radicalized white guy is not called a terrorist.

635
00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:26.838
- Ron Noblet: Just an angry white guy.

636
00:34:26.838 --> 00:34:27.846
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Just an angry white guy right.

637
00:34:27.846 --> 00:34:29.001
- And same thing with gangs right?

638
00:34:29.001 --> 00:34:32.449
- So young black man who is involved in a clique group

639
00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.231
- and angry and doing some different things.

640
00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:35.035
- Well, that's a gang member.

641
00:34:35.035 --> 00:34:36.604
- But people don't say the same thing

642
00:34:36.604 --> 00:34:39.080
- about the white equivalent to that person.

643
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.093
- Ron Noblet: Exactly.

644
00:34:40.093 --> 00:34:44.292
- A guy doesn't join a gang because he wants to do violent things or criminal things.

645
00:34:44.292 --> 00:34:48.856
- He joins a gang because it offers something that he's not getting.

646
00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:49.893
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Right right.

647
00:34:49.893 --> 00:34:52.723
- Safety, protection, community.

648
00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:53.324
- Ron Noblet: Love.

649
00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.421
- Bradley Thomas Rowe:

650
00:34:54.421 --> 00:34:55.873
- Love.

651
00:34:55.873 --> 00:34:57.159
- Wow!

652
00:34:57.159 --> 00:34:59.172
- So we are in California, right?

653
00:34:59.172 --> 00:35:1.759
- We're a bordering state to Mexico.

654
00:35:1.759 --> 00:35:5.943
- What do you think we need to do either in Los Angeles,

655
00:35:5.943 --> 00:35:8.291
- or maybe it's with our state kind of,

656
00:35:8.291 --> 00:35:10.858
- with the immigration situation?

657
00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:14.541
- Is our current immigration policy,

658
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:17.108
- the deportations,

659
00:35:17.108 --> 00:35:20.945
- the criminalization of illegal entry?

660
00:35:20.945 --> 00:35:27.552
- How is that affecting radicalization of youth or of indoctrination into gangs?

661
00:35:27.552 --> 00:35:32.666
- Or is the difficulty of passage the expensive passage?

662
00:35:32.666 --> 00:35:38.704
- Does that simply cause people to pay more

663
00:35:38.704 --> 00:35:40.005
- and to get the tougher dudes

664
00:35:40.005 --> 00:35:43.349
- to get through and across and more bigger,

665
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:45.023
- stronger, more entrenched,

666
00:35:45.023 --> 00:35:47.137
- protected networks to get through?

667
00:35:47.137 --> 00:35:48.878
- How do the dynamics change

668
00:35:48.878 --> 00:35:52.731
- when we start to sort of create a tougher,

669
00:35:52.731 --> 00:35:53.409
- more punitive border?

670
00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:55.858
- If you have any ideason that.

671
00:35:55.858 --> 00:35:57.115
- Ron Noblet: Got a couple.

672
00:35:57.115 --> 00:35:59.333
- Starting from the beginning.

673
00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:1.007
- There is no policy.

674
00:36:1.007 --> 00:36:4.030
- There is no policy one way or another,

675
00:36:4.030 --> 00:36:5.405
- that’s number one.

676
00:36:5.405 --> 00:36:5.994
- Number two, people

677
00:36:5.994 --> 00:36:9.338
- are coming up from Central America right now

678
00:36:9.338 --> 00:36:10.356
- because they're scared.

679
00:36:10.356 --> 00:36:15.789
- This is the only choices you have when you're in those when you’re in the triangle of Guatemala,

680
00:36:15.789 --> 00:36:17.059
- Honduras, El Salvador.

681
00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:18.264
- Join a gang,

682
00:36:18.264 --> 00:36:20.677
- get murdered,

683
00:36:20.677 --> 00:36:22.054
- run

684
00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:24.887
- or become an addict.

685
00:36:24.887 --> 00:36:27.947
- There is no other choice.

686
00:36:27.947 --> 00:36:29.853
- People don't want to die.

687
00:36:29.853 --> 00:36:32.460
- There are no jobs.

688
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:39.023
- The way life is rough and it is abusive.

689
00:36:39.023 --> 00:36:41.911
- The governments do not protect them.

690
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:43.795
- They have to protect themselves.

691
00:36:43.795 --> 00:36:46.260
- You either run or you die.

692
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:52.929
- The trail from Central America through Mexico

693
00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:59.275
- to the US border is a trail of violence imposed upon them.

694
00:36:59.275 --> 00:37:3.992
- Women when they reach the Guatemalan border,

695
00:37:3.992 --> 00:37:5.242
- getting ready to go into Mexico

696
00:37:5.242 --> 00:37:9.5
- are already buying stuff knowing

697
00:37:9.5 --> 00:37:12.217
- or providing themselves

698
00:37:12.217 --> 00:37:15.085
- with things knowing that they're going to be raped

699
00:37:15.085 --> 00:37:17.054
- on the trail.

700
00:37:17.054 --> 00:37:19.768
- But they still want to get to the United States.

701
00:37:19.768 --> 00:37:21.460
- They want to get to the United States

702
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.465
- because that's the only chance they have to live.

703
00:37:23.465 --> 00:37:26.996
- The Mexicans going across are now.

704
00:37:26.996 --> 00:37:32.492
- There is a net outflow from the United States into Mexico.

705
00:37:32.492 --> 00:37:34.885
- The Mexicans are not the ones who wanted to come across here.

706
00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:37.467
- It's the Central Americans to save their own lives.

707
00:37:37.467 --> 00:37:41.019
- The gang members basically

708
00:37:41.019 --> 00:37:44.661
- prey upon the people who are coming up

709
00:37:44.661 --> 00:37:48.242
- and they don't necessarily protect them or help them across.

710
00:37:48.242 --> 00:37:49.382
- They prey upon them.

711
00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:54.389
- The coyotes are separate separate types of gangs.

712
00:37:54.389 --> 00:37:59.177
- These in Maine are guys who come from generations of smugglers.

713
00:37:59.177 --> 00:38:1.231
- They already have their routes.

714
00:38:1.231 --> 00:38:4.273
- The Sinaloa Cartel,

715
00:38:4.273 --> 00:38:6.068
- all the cartels that come out of Sinaloa

716
00:38:6.068 --> 00:38:8.322
- they have been smugglers for two hundred years.

717
00:38:8.322 --> 00:38:9.440
- For them,

718
00:38:9.440 --> 00:38:10.552
- it's a product.

719
00:38:10.552 --> 00:38:12.114
- Product whether it's people,

720
00:38:12.114 --> 00:38:13.036
- marijuana,

721
00:38:13.036 --> 00:38:14.123
- cattle,

722
00:38:14.123 --> 00:38:15.043
- goats.

723
00:38:15.043 --> 00:38:16.184
- You name it.

724
00:38:16.184 --> 00:38:17.851
- Cocaine, heroin.

725
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:24.570
- Many of the routes now that have been historically run by coyotes

726
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.346
- to bring people in within the United States

727
00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:29.347
- have now been taken over by cartels.

728
00:38:29.347 --> 00:38:32.532
- But they don't necessarily go together.

729
00:38:32.532 --> 00:38:33.728
- In the Maine,

730
00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:35.333
- its people who are coming up.

731
00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:36.706
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: By taking over you mean you have to pay tax.

732
00:38:36.706 --> 00:38:39.614
- You have to pay for protection to get through or they're actually running?

733
00:38:39.614 --> 00:38:41.137
- Ron Noblet: They are running it now.

734
00:38:41.137 --> 00:38:40.956
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: They’re running it?

735
00:38:40.956 --> 00:38:41.998
- Okay.

736
00:38:41.998 --> 00:38:43.538
- Ron Noblet: They’re running it.

737
00:38:43.538 --> 00:38:47.148
- The people who pay coyotes to come across that's one thing.

738
00:38:47.148 --> 00:38:50.536
- But people in the Maine are just everything is taken from them

739
00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:52.623
- or stolen from them on the way up.

740
00:38:52.623 --> 00:38:54.076
- And that is just they’re preyed upon by gangs.

741
00:38:54.076 --> 00:38:56.693
- It is more like wolves preying upon moving herds.

742
00:38:56.693 --> 00:39:4.485
- There has been some excellent writing

743
00:39:4.485 --> 00:39:7.697
- done on taking that train up here.

744
00:39:7.697 --> 00:39:9.056
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: La Bestia?

745
00:39:9.056 --> 00:39:12.612
- Ron Noblet: Yeah and its powerful, its powerful.

746
00:39:12.612 --> 00:39:17.815
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: One of the things you had shared with me

747
00:39:17.815 --> 00:39:22.538
- ways back was with regards to this idea of human trafficking and slavery.

748
00:39:22.538 --> 00:39:27.737
- Is it in plain sight here in LA?

749
00:39:27.737 --> 00:39:29.322
- Are we?

750
00:39:29.322 --> 00:39:29.925
- Ron Noblet: Yes.

751
00:39:29.925 --> 00:39:30.684
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Ok.

752
00:39:30.684 --> 00:39:32.509
- And how do we, how do we address that?

753
00:39:32.509 --> 00:39:37.847
- Ron Noblet: I wouldn't.

754
00:39:37.847 --> 00:39:43.527
- I wouldn't use an innocuous term that bureaucrats use like human trafficking.

755
00:39:43.527 --> 00:39:45.728
- I would say flat out slavery,

756
00:39:45.728 --> 00:39:46.612
- number one.

757
00:39:46.612 --> 00:39:50.594
- Cause most people what they don't want to see things.

758
00:39:50.594 --> 00:39:52.639
- And so they give it little wimpy names,

759
00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:54.246
- how the bureaucrats give wimpy names.

760
00:39:54.246 --> 00:39:57.436
- But you have you have slavery,

761
00:39:57.436 --> 00:40:9.402
- human slavery in any field that requires intense labor taking place right now.

762
00:40:9.402 --> 00:40:11.606
- Chinese, Cambodians

763
00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:13.300
- are heavy,

764
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:19.018
- heavy groups of slaves working in what looks like an innocuous apartment house.

765
00:40:19.018 --> 00:40:20.768
- There might be a hundred,

766
00:40:20.768 --> 00:40:21.927
- hundred fifty people

767
00:40:21.927 --> 00:40:23.429
- in there who are basically slaves.

768
00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:30.418
- The sex slavery is in different arenas.

769
00:40:30.418 --> 00:40:35.186
- Most of the people now who are being trafficked are in the greater LA

770
00:40:35.186 --> 00:40:37.735
- and across the country are African Americans

771
00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.146
- being trafficked by gangs.

772
00:40:39.146 --> 00:40:41.320
- By their own gang members.

773
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.021
- But they're also people

774
00:40:45.021 --> 00:40:48.981
- who are brought up through Tijuana

775
00:40:48.981 --> 00:40:51.760
- that I have seen where the women are broken in Tijuana.

776
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.449
- Brought from someplace else,

777
00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:54.369
- broken in Tijuana,

778
00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:57.943
- then brought across here as sex slaves.

779
00:40:57.943 --> 00:40:59.867
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: What does that mean to be broken into?

780
00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:3.148
- Ron Noblet: They're broken so they are compliant.

781
00:41:3.148 --> 00:41:4.373
- They’re physically,

782
00:41:4.373 --> 00:41:11.440
- emotionally broken and they have guys who do just whose job it is to break them,

783
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:12.896
- so that they'll be more compliant,

784
00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:14.152
- easier to control.

785
00:41:14.152 --> 00:41:19.592
- And more and more gangs are going and groups are going into the human slavery

786
00:41:19.592 --> 00:41:20.523
- and the sexual trafficking,

787
00:41:20.523 --> 00:41:27.003
- basically because you can use a woman

788
00:41:27.003 --> 00:41:30.693
- over and over and over again and just her value goes down.

789
00:41:30.693 --> 00:41:32.244
- When they can't be used anymore,

790
00:41:32.244 --> 00:41:35.902
- you just get rid of them and that's how they deal with it.

791
00:41:35.902 --> 00:41:39.195
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: So that's the difference between a commodity

792
00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:41.327
- and something that continues to generate.

793
00:41:41.327 --> 00:41:41.130
- Ron Noblet: Yeah.

794
00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.657
- Single use commodities and with and with the women

795
00:41:44.657 --> 00:41:45.302
- multiple used commodities.

796
00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:49.021
- And I separate the sexual aspect of it

797
00:41:49.021 --> 00:41:50.833
- from the workers aspect of it.

798
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.954
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: What are some of the areas

799
00:41:53.954 --> 00:41:59.900
- that if these students are looking for opportunities for work,

800
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:3.583
- for areas where they can make an impact or they can make a difference?

801
00:42:3.583 --> 00:42:8.617
- Where should a UCLA or graduate from another school go?

802
00:42:8.617 --> 00:42:12.833
- Ron Noblet: I would say be honest with yourself.

803
00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:15.262
- Are you looking for money?

804
00:42:15.262 --> 00:42:17.440
- Are you looking for recognition?

805
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.092
- Or are you looking to help people?

806
00:42:19.092 --> 00:42:25.503
- If you're looking for money and or recognition,

807
00:42:25.503 --> 00:42:29.967
- go work with the government of one sort or another.

808
00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:33.599
- Go become professional social work type of person.

809
00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:37.469
- If you’re looking for recognition,

810
00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:41.322
- go join, get involved with a foundation.

811
00:42:41.322 --> 00:42:43.181
- If you want to help people,

812
00:42:43.181 --> 00:42:49.438
- learn to not be afraid of violence per se.

813
00:42:49.438 --> 00:42:54.101
- But it requires an internal look

814
00:42:54.101 --> 00:42:57.199
- and an internal acceptance

815
00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:59.393
- that few people are willing to face

816
00:42:59.393 --> 00:43:7.483
- on their own and often only face under challenging conditions.

817
00:43:7.483 --> 00:43:10.007
- My recommendation

818
00:43:10.007 --> 00:43:13.726
- is look inside and be honest with yourself.

819
00:43:13.726 --> 00:43:17.097
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Awesome!

820
00:43:17.097 --> 00:43:18.706
- Thanks Ron.

821
00:43:18.706 --> 00:43:20.030
- Ron Noblet: Thank you.

822
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.736
- Bradley Thomas Rowe: Appreciate it.

823
00:43:20.736 --> 00:43:21.493
- Ron Noblet: I want more coffee.
